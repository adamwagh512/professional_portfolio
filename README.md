## About
This is a professional portfolio page for Adam Wagh. I made this page to showcase some of my favorite projects. I am always working on something new so please check back often to see my latest completed works. 
## How To Use

## Acknowledgments
### Welcome Page
I modified a codepen.io project from J Voorendt for the typing effect on my welcome page. His codepen.io profile can be found [here](https://codepen.io/Hikisu/)

I would also like to acknowledge the artist that made the video I used for my background, but I couldn't find his name. I am just going to paste the link where I found the video [here](https://gfycat.com/adeptfalsejunco-kanadaka-content-for-creators). 
### Portfolio Page
I modified a codepen.io project from Pham Mikun for my portfolio section. This developer had an impressive design and  exellent documentation which made modification easy. Please check out their codepen.io page [here](https://codepen.io/mikun/)

### Readme 
The technology badges were provided by Ileriayo Adebiyi, his repo is found [here](https://github.com/Ileriayo/markdown-badges)
